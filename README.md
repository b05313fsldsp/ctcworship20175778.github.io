# 1.0. The story of Musk
Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, Transvaal, South Africa,the son of Maye Musk (née Haldeman), a model and dietician from Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada;and Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot and sailor. During his childhood he was an avid reader.At age 10, he developed an interest in computing with the Commodore VIC-20.He taught himself computer programming at the age of 12, sold the code for a BASIC-based video game he created called Blastar, to a magazine called PC and Office Technology, for approximately $500. A web version of the game is available online.

# 1.1. The Way of the Program
The single most important skill for a computer scientist is **problem solving**. Problem solving means the ability to formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and express a solution clearly and accurately. As it turns out, the process of learning to program is an excellent opportunity to practice problem solving skills. That’s why this chapter is called, The Way of the Program.
On one level, you will be learning to program, a useful skill by itself. On another level, you will use programming as a means to an end. As we go along, that end will become clearer.
